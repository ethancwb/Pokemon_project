### URL: https://cs3200-final-project.herokuapp.com/#!/ <br />

### Install guide: <br />
1. Install node.js to your local machine if you don’t have one. Type: “brew install node” in terminal to install or go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download it. <br />
2. Clone or download the web package to local. <br />
3. Open your console and direct yourself inside the project folder. <br />
4. Run Command: “npm install” to install all the project dependencies. <br />
5. Run Command: “node server.js” or  “npm run begin” to serve the web-app locally. <br />
6. Our project runs in port 8080 in default, so Open your browser and put in: “localhost:8080“ to enter the webapp. <br />
<br />
Note: You still need to connect to internet even you choose to run the project locally, since our backend database still needs to connect to the remote database server. A better way is just go to our online instance: https://cs3200-final-project.herokuapp.com <br />
